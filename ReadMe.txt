Reversed Arrays:


Goals:

1. getting familiar with ArrayList (Collections) 

2. comparing unequal ArrayList in terms of Indexes.

Algorithm:
  
1. adding numbers to ArrayList by the help of Scanner

2. using the method for reversing

3. sum of the items in the reversed lists 

4. reversing the result of sum reversed list

Example  : 

input : a = [2,4,3]  ,  b = [5,6,4]


output:

reversed First array: [3, 4, 2]
reversed Second Array: [4, 6, 5]
sum array : [8, 0, 7]
reversed sum array : [7, 0, 8]
